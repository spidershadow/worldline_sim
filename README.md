# Singularity Window Analysis

This project analyzes the singularity window phenomenon in random number generation, focusing on the relationship between Global Consciousness Project (GCP) and Unusual Animal Phenomena (UAP) data. The analysis examines potential correlations and patterns during specific time windows.

## Overview

The singularity window analysis investigates whether there are statistically significant correlations between GCP and UAP data during specific time periods. The project includes:

- Data processing and analysis
- Statistical correlation testing
- Visualization of results
- Comprehensive reporting
